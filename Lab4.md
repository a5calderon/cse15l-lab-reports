---------
Task 1) Log into ieng6

For this step, I simply had to just do : ``` ssh cs15lsp23du@ieng6.ucsd.edu``` (and no password!).


Task 2) Clone your fork of the repository from your Github account

Like other times, I used ```git clone``` and the link from my repository. 

Task 3) Run the tests, demonstrating that they fail

After cloning, I checked where I was by using ```ls```. This reminded me to change the directory to lab7 ( which I did by ```cd lab7```. After this, I can use ```ls``` again to get a look at what is inside this directory. One thing I saw here was a bash file, so at this point I used ``` bash test.sh``` to run the J unit tests. After this, I saw that a test failed. 

Task 4) Edit the code file to fix the failing test

Task 5) Run the tests, demonstrating that they now succeed

Task 6) Commit and push the resulting change to your Github account (you can pick any commit message!)
