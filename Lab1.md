## Step Two: Remotely Connecting 
FINDING THE TERMINAL: Under the "Start" heading, there's an option to create a new file. Click on that and name your file (make sure to add ".java" at the end). Next, open up the terminal (there's this button-- called the toggle panel--on the upper right that looks like a square that has a line through its lower 1/3).

Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? `
In this case, press yes.
