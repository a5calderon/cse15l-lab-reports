# **Lab Report 5:  Debugging**
---------
# Part 1) Debugging Scenario 

Student Post on EdStem : 
---------
What environment are you using (computer, operating system, web browser, terminal/editor, and so on)?


Detail the symptom you're seeing. Be specific; include both what you're seeing and what you expected to see instead. Screenshots are great, copy-pasted terminal output is also great. Avoid saying “it doesn't work”.



Detail the failure-inducing input and context. That might mean any or all of the command you're running, a test case, command-line arguments, working directory, even the last few commands you ran. Do your best to provide as much context as you can.

TA Response:
---------
(either asking a leading question or suggesting a command to try) 

Student Response:
---------
(another screenshot/terminal output showing what info the student got from trying that and a clear description of what the bug is)

Information about the setup:
---------
- the file and directory structure (should have at least a java file and a bash script)
- the contents of each file before fixing the bug 
- the full command line (or lines) you ran to trigger the bug 
- a description of what to edit to fix the bug 


# Part 2) Reflection 
- describe something you learned from you lab experience in second half of this quarter (a technical topic, something you learned from a tutor or classmate, etc)
